# Task Management App

a Task Management Application using React, based on the
provided UX/UI design in Figma. The application should allow users to create, edit, delete,
and organize tasks into categories. Users should also be able to mark tasks as complete
and filter tasks by their completion status or category.

## Project Structure

For this project, I used a combination of Layered Structure and Feature-Based Structure:

Layered Structure: This approach organizes the code into different layers based on concerns, ensuring a clean and maintainable architecture.
Feature-Based Structure for components: This method organizes components by features or modules, which is ideal for scalable applications that have multiple independent features.
